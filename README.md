# First
Sum of two fractions

here are two fractions. 
The first has a numerator "first" with a denominator "second" and the second "third" and "fourth". 
  If these two fractions have two denominators in common, of which second == fourth, we make the sum of the two numerators "first" and "third", with the denominator in common.
  
  Otherwise, we multiply the numerator "first" of the first fraction with the second denominator "fourth", the same for "third" and "second", all on the product of both denominators.
